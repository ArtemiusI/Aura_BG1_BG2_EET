This is an all-in-one version for Aura NPC for Baldur's Gate, with BG1 and BG2 content included. EET compatibility is also supported, though only loosely tested.

In Baldur's Gate 1, Aura may be found in Beregost.

In Siege of Dragonspear, Aura may be found west of the Coast Way Crossing.

In Baldur's Gate 2, Aura may be found by looking for her in the Jansen home in the Slums (try to go up the stairs to see an event), then travelling to Waukeen's Promenade.
