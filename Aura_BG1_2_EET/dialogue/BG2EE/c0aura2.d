~Sure. Let's see... you'll probably want to know about the most interesting places, right? Well, to start off, there's Sambar—that's our capital city. The Sambaran Academy is the main institute of study in the whole nation. Anyone who's ever wanted a place in the major guilds of Lantan is going to learn from there—yours truly included, of course!~
= ~Next is Anchoril. That's where I was born, by the way. It's a lovely town that's right by the eastern coast of the island. It's not as grand as the bigger cities, but it's known as the center of foreign trade for the nation. That makes it quite a lively place, too!~
= ~Illul is the western side of Lantan, and it's home to the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration, which makes it the centerpiece of the church of Gond. I haven't been there all too often, but my sister Luna serves there as a Seeker... that's sort of like a cross of an artificer and a priestess.~
= ~The rest are mostly settlements where our clans make their homes—Darluj, Dtakkar, and others. Oh, and the island of Orlil... that's the least inhabited place in Lantan, but it's where our bards and arcanists reside.~

~Ooh, you'd have to see for yourself to understand... it's nothing like the cities you'd see anywhere else. Lantan is full of lush jungle that gets thicker the closer you get to the center of the islands. It's not possible to build settlements on the ground without harming the ecosystem, so we build our homes up high among the trees.~
= ~You might not even realize you're in a Lantanese city unless you thought to look up. Then you'd see the platforms on which our houses are built, all connected to each other via bridges and ladders. It's really something unique.~
= ~I grew up in Anchoril, though, which is right by the coast. It's much closer to the kind of port town you might be familiar with. Our community is focused on fishing, agriculture and foreign trade, so we're a bit more connected to the outside world than the other settlements.~

= ~The church of Gond is rather divided on their stance on magic, but their views aren't entirely opposed for the most part. Some believe magic should be treated like any other tool or craft, while others believe everything done by magic has a non-magical alternative. There are some Lantanese who oppose magic entirely, but they're... rare, and not looked upon favorably.~
= ~Although we don't have any proper institution for studying magic, so anyone who has an interest in it has to travel to other regions like Neverwinter, Waterdeep or Silverymoon, or be apprenticed to the few arcanists who live in Orlil.

If anything I thought I knew about Yoshi-san was real, he wouldn't have fought a battle he had no chance of winning. But he couldn't. No matter how much he may have wanted to... I don't know, take it all back, or run away... he couldn't. Isn't that just horrifying?~

~(As close as you are to Aura's face, you notice how her nose, despite being slightly larger than average by any other race's standards, is unusually smaller and fey-like, with a sharper, more defined shape that complements her youthful features.)~
= ~(When you finally pull away, Aura smiles at you, only for a strange expression to suddenly take over as her nose twitches. A second later, she sneezes.)~

~(As you wrap your arms around Aura's waist and bring her close, she presses herself against you, and you enjoy the softness of her body closely against yours.)~
EXIT

~(Aura gives a cry of shock as you lift her from the ground, her arms reaching for you as you pull her close to you for an embrace. She nuzzles your neck as you hold her by the waist.)~

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-5C
~(Surprisingly, Aura puts up a meager resistance as you playfully attack her ticklish spots. When you detect a glint of mischief in her eyes, you realize―a little too late―that you've made a careless mistake.~
= ~Haha! You've fallen for my trap! Get her, Muffy!~
= ~(The small squirrel construct leaps onto you and runs crazily over your body in circles from head to toe, its tiny metal paws tickling you endlessly as you struggle to capture it.)~

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-7A
~(Aura flushes furiously as you lay a finger teasingly on her nose.)~
EXIT

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-7B

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-8A
~(As you tenderly stroke the long, straight strands of Aura's hair, you notice how well-tended it is. Her hair is clean, even, and smells faintly of rose and lavender. You cannot help but wonder just how much time she spends tending to her hair at night to make up for the roughness of your daily travels.)~
EXIT

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-8B
~(After you brush against Aura's hair for a while, she clasps your hand and holds it against her cheek, gently caressing your fingers with a slight smile.)~
= ~(Suddenly she blushes, and with a flustered expression, reaches in her pack hurriedly to take out a small wooden brush.)~
= ~Umm... would you mind brushing my hair a bit, <CHARNAME>? I'd like that.~
EXIT

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-8C
~(As you trace a strand of Aura's rose-colored hair to its roots on her head, you see the faint change of colour to its natural pale―almost silvery―blonde.~
= ~Aura lets off a giggle as your finger slides against her head, clearly ticklish.)~

EXIT

CHAIN C0AUR25J FLIRT-1-9A
~(You sneak up on Aura from behind and teasingly nip on the point of her ear that is slightly sticking out from under her hair. She makes a startled squeak and turns to face you.)~
